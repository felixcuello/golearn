# GO Learn

I want to learn Go because apparently we'll migrate our current code from Ruby
to Go, so there's a big chance here to start working on Go.

Nevertheless I never used Go before and I will use this repository to write some
Go code.

I usually don't like to install things into my computer (specially because I am
working mostly in my company's computer), so I will use `Docker` and `Makefile`
as a form to dettach this Go language from my computer.
